<p>Advances in information technology have made the process of collecting huge amounts of data not only possible, but also extremely easy. The massive quantities of data available in the modern era enable scientists, social scientists, government agencies and companies to ask and answer questions in order to understand the physical world, make pubic policies, and improve productivity. For example, data can now be used to provide answers to an extremely broad array of questions such as &quot;is there a link between alcohol and birth defects?&quot; and &quot;what is the chance that Hilary Clinton will win the next election?&quot;. Statistics is an indispensable tool in the process of extracting meaningful answers to the questions being asked based on the collected data. In fact, statistics is more than an analysis tool: statistical experimental design provides principles and methods for ensuring that the data is collected in such a way that facilitates the investigators&#39; ability to effectively address the questions asked.</p>

<p>The tools provided by statistics were first developed as instruments used to solve real-world problems such as demographic census collection and agricultural experiments. As the types of data being collected grew more intricate, detailed and complex, so too did the accompanying statistical methods and the assumptions upon which they are based. Consequently, analyzing a dataset with no real-world knowledge of how the data was collected or what the numbers represent is the equivalent to <FONT COLOR="red">some nice analogy</FONT>. For example, in the famous <em>iris</em> dataset, R.A. Fisher (who was not only a statistician, but also an evolutionary biologist and a geneticist) measured the length and width of both the petal and sepal of a number of iris flowers. His domain knowledge of flowers led him to take these measurements but not the roots, stem thickness or chemical makeup of each flower. <FONT COLOR="red">come up with a better example</FONT>.</p>

<p>To ensure that useful questions are asked and valid answers are drawn, domain experts (scientists, for example) should always be in the picture for statisticians to strengthen their domain knowledge by asking questions and brainstorming. Data does not stand alone: it must be viewed with a strong consideration towards the questions being asked, the scientific background of the problem and the data collection process.</p>

<p>This idea can be conveyed through the concept of <em>data wisdom</em>. In <em>Data Wisdom for Data Science</em>, a piece I wrote for the big data website, <em>Operational Database Management Systems</em>, I describe data wisdom as &quot;the ability to combine domain, mathematical and methodological knowledge with experience, understanding, common sense, insight and good judgement in order to think critically about data and to make decisions based on data&quot;. The essence of data wisdom can be encompassed in the following set of (not necessarily sequential) questions that a data analyst is encouraged to ask before embarking on and during any data analysis project. First, it is important to explicitly formulate questions to ask. This is where the domain experts come in. They will know which questions are important and how to properly formulate them. Next, it is important to identify the most relevant data to collect to answer the question we are interested in exploring. If the analyst did not collect the data themselves, they should be asking how, when and where the data were collected and what the data is measuring (more explicitly, what does each number in the dataset actually mean?). </p>

<p>Having identified the data, the analyst must then translate the question being asked into a statistical setting. For example, if there are multiple possible translations (such as a translation into a prediction problem or a translation into an inference problem regarding a statistical model), which is the most appropriate? Further, the analyst should assess the ability of the data to satisfy the assumptions made by the translation chosen. For example, are the data units are comparable (you don&#39;t want to combine apples and oranges)? Do they need to be normalized? Visualization is an incredibly useful tool for assessing the suitability of both the data and statistical translation. Assessing plots of the data can reveal patterns, inconsistencies and unexpected data points that may require further examination. Further, It is extremely important to identify where the randomness in the data comes from (for example, was it from the sampling procedure or a random treatment assignment mechanism?). The source of randomness in the data must correspond to the randomness assumed by the statistical model. </p>

<p>The next step is to explore the validity of the conclusions drawn. For example, do different methods yield the same qualitative conclusions? Do perturbations (perhaps by adding noise or subsampling exchangeable data units) change the conclusions drawn? Such checks are vital in ensuring reproducibility. Finally, the conclusions should be explicitly tested through validation methods, such as by testing the conclusions on other kinds of data.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of this book is to demonstrate what it is like to work together with people with domain expertise in order to do data analysis with the aim of answering questions outside statistics. Further, as a reader of this book, you will gain insight into the many steps involved in the iterative process of extracting information from data for the purposes of prediction and interpretation. In particular, this book will provide the necessary background to cover basic useful statistical methods in practice and will highlight how judgement and common sense should be used in the process of data analysis and when arriving at valid conclusions.</p>

<p>Statistical techniques will be introduced through a first-principles approach with a focus on developing intuition, and the reader will learn how to develop appropriate techniques in unfamiliar situations. A number of data analysis labs are provided which are designed to help the reader put into practice the techniques and intuition conveyed throughout the book.</p>

<p>It is assumed that the reader is familiar with concepts typically introduced in upper division mathematical statistics and probability courses. Further, to get the most out of the labs, the reader is encouraged to have familiarity with writing functions, manipulating and cleaning data and creating graphics in a programming language such as R or python.</p>

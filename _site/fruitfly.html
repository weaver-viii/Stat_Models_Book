<h1>The <em>Drasophila</em> fruitfly project</h1>

<p>Throughout this book we will embed many of the concepts we are examining within a real-life project, which we will call &quot;the fruitfly project&quot;. The fruitfly project is a genomics project that I have been involved in with several of my students and my collaborators at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). <FONT COLOR="red">How did I get involved in this project? How was I introduced to Erwin and co?</FONT>. As most do, the fruitfly project began with a question: &quot;Is spatial information useful for making gene-gene interaction discoveries?&quot;. To expand and de-code this question for the non-biologists, what the group was really asking is whether it is possible to use image data (for example images of stained drasophila embryos) to identify if . The staining process involves staining using dye certain products (typically proteins) which are highlights physically where in the embryo a particular gene is being expressed.  With this question in mind, the group of biologists at LBNL had generated 1640 spatial gene expression images <FONT COLOR="red">I need an image!</FONT> representing 755 genes for early <em>Drasophila</em> embryos. In <FONT COLOR="red">the figurer</FONT>, the gene of interest is being expressed at each location where the blue stain is visible. Each processed expression image can be represented by a numeric vector with 405 entries, one for each of the 405 pixels inside the ellipse template.</p>

<li><p>What was the process that lead to using the non-negative matrix factorization? Was that the first approach? Did you first try things that didn&#39;t work?</p></li>

<h1>Method Validation</h1>

<p>The previous sections have introduced a plethora of data models which could be used as tools for answering questions using data. However, we have only briefly touched upon a discussion of the different methods of model validation, or assessing how well these models are fitting the data (a step that is too often ignored). It is extremely important that we don&#39;t simply go on blind model-fitting rampages without stopping to evaluate how well the methods we are using fit the data at hand. Without model validation, there is no reason to trust the conclusions drawn. In this section we will discuss methods of validation and provide examples.</p>

<h3>Visualization</h3>

<p>Visualization of data is an extremely useful way to validate that a procedure is working well. If we can examine the data with our own eyes, we are much more likely to obtain an accurate understanding of the structure of the data and be able to evaluate the results of our models.</p>

<h4>Residual plots</h4>

<p>If we can visualize the data, for example by plotting residuals against a variable of interest or the fitted values, then we can get a feel for where a linear model works well and where it does not. Recall our discussion of residual plots in our section on <a href="http://rlbarter.github.io/Stat_Models_Book/8-linear.html">linear models</a>. The patterns of the residuals give helpful clues about whether the model is fitting the data well. For example, residuals randomly scattered about zero indicate that the model fits well, whereas residuals whose variance increases as the fitted values (or a variable of interest) get larger/smaller, is indicative of <em>heteroskedasticity</em>, or non-constant variance, in the data (perhaps we should have fit the linear model using generalized least squares instead!)</p>

<h3>Prediction</h3>

<p>If a linear or classification model produces accurate predictions, then it is likely that the model is capturing some of the underlying mechanisms that exist in the data generation process. Although there exist a number of methods often considered to be &quot;uninterpretable&quot; or are known to be biased that provide better predictions than the more interpretable models. For classification models, we typically assess the quality of predictions using the classification error on an independent test set (a subset of the data that was not used to define the model); the proportion of observations that are misclassified.</p>

<p>$$\text{classification error } = \frac{\#\{\text{false positives}\} + \#\{\text{false negative}\}}{\#\{\text{test samples}\}}$$</p>

<p>where a false positive is the case where the predicted class/response is $\hat{y} = 1$ but the true class is $y = 0$, and a false negative is the case where the predicted class is $\hat{y} = 0$ but the true value is $y = 1$.</p>

<p>For a model with a continuous response (such as a linear model), we typically look at the residual sum of squares (RSS); a measure of the difference between the predicted values and the true values. For example, suppose we have a linear model $y =  X\beta + \epsilon$, then the predicted values are given by $\hat{y} = X \hat{\beta}$, and the RSS is given by</p>

<p>$$RSS = \sum_{i=1}^n (\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2$$</p>

<p>however, again, ideally we would calculate the corresponding sum of squares using an independent test set, rather than the original observations.</p>

<h3>Interpretability</h3>

<p>If our model can be shown to have a meaningful interpretation, then we might be more inclined to accept its results. For example, suppose that we were conducting an experiment to identify genes that differ between cancer patients and healthy patients and we found that a particular subset of genes had a significantly different expression pattern in the cancer patients than the healthy patients. If domain experts were already aware that at least some of these genes were biologically meaningful (for example they were already known to play a role in the progression or development of the particular cancer), then it would not be unreasonable to postulate that the other gnees found to differ significantly between the two groups are also important. That is, we have used the domain knowledge confirmation that some of our results are meaningful to provide credence to the notion that the other results might be too. Applied statisticians are encouraged to communicate with domain experts to identify whether their results are meaningful. An idea is to show the domain experts, not just your results, but also manipulated results (for example by selecting random gene names) and let them choose which list is more meaningful. This kind of approach can be used to ensure that your domain knowledge collaborators are not simply finding interpretations of your results because they tend to see what they want to see, or want to find results where there are none.</p>

<h3>Replication of results</h3>

<p>Perhaps one of the most important techniques for validation of results is to replicate the results in an independent setting. Unfortunately, there are many naive approaches to &quot;replication&quot; which can provide a misleading sense of confidence; primarily when the validation is performed using the same data that was used to generate the model or draw the conclusions. This is an example of <em>data snooping</em>, another example of which is to use a dataset to fish for interesting facts and then subsequently use the same dataset to prove these facts! Data snooping often leads to overfitting of models, high false positive rates and selective simulation results (choosing the simulation results that look the best, but are not necessarily representative).</p>

<p>How can we avoid data snooping? Probably the best is to have another lab or group replicate the experiment by generating completely new data and performing their own analysis. If they independently arrive at the same conclusions, then we have stronger evidence in favor of the validity our conclusions and models. Unfortunately, however, in most situations it is impractical to have others independently repeat our experiments. For this reason, it is good practice to use a test set of data points (or set aside a test set from our overall dataset) so that we can use this test data at a later date to validate the conclusions drawn and models developed from the remaining training data. In general, it is recommended that exploratory data analysis and confirmatory data analysis should be done on separate datasets if possible, otherwise the best approach is to perform these tasks on separate subsets of the original dataset.</p>

<h3>Robustness</h3>

<p>Ideally our conclusions and methods should be robust both to the specific samples used as well as departures from model assumptions.</p>

<h4>Robustness to sampling</h4>

<p>One approach to identifying whether or not your results are nonsense is to perturb the data (for example by resampling and using various different random subsets of the data) and re-evaluate your results or re-fit your model. If you are obtaining equivalent results on the perturbed data, then this means that the results were not dependent on the specific set of observations used (this is a good thing!). If however your results are extremely variable based on which subset of the data you use, then this should lead you to be heavily suspicious of the results. If this is the case, then it is likely that the particular model being used is not yielding robust or reliable results, and you should search for alternative methods.</p>

<h4>Robustness to assumptions</h4>

<p>There is also the question of how robust our conclusions are to the assumptions of the model used. For example, if the model assumes normality, how reasonable are our conclusions when our data is not <em>exactly</em> normal? For most commonly used methods, there exist a lot of work describing the effect of departures from the base assumptions. For example, it is known that $t$-tests are somewhat robust to the normality assumption (particularly for large sample sizes), whereas $F$-tests are not. It is thus important to assess not only whether your data satisfies the required assumptions of your analysis, but also, if there are indeed slight deviations, to assess whether this has significantly affected the conclusions drawn. If the effects of departures from the model assumptions are not known for the method at hand, then it might be an idea to conduct some simulations.</p>

<h3>The likelihood ratio test</h3>

<p>A more traditional approach to model checking is to perform a <em>likelihood ratio test</em> (often referred to as an $F$-test in the regression literature). For a saturated model (a model which has as many parameters as there is information in the data), suppose that $y_i \sim Binomial(\pi_i, n_i)$. Then we estimate</p>

<p>$$\tilde{\pi}_i  = \frac{y_i}{n_i}$$</p>

<p>where  with $n_i$ not too small. </p>

## Philosophy

1. The importance of experimental design: people believe that when you have numbers, somehow the answer just pops up. 

1. The importance of communication people skills -- you want to be someone people can work with. Even if you don't have the skills they need, the will still come to you if they like you -- get involved. Most people (professors) learn by talking with people with experience.

1. The importance of critical thinking -- non-conventional problem. Making judgement calls (much harder to learn than mathematical skills).

1. The "importance of the theorem" -- and how not every theorem is a good theorem!
